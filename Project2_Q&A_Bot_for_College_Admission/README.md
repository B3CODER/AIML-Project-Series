# Q&A Bot for College Admission

This project is a Q&A bot for college admission built with Flask that can respond to user inquiries about the college admission process. It handles various admission-related questions and provides appropriate responses.

## Why We Need a Chatbot

A chatbot can handle repetitive queries efficiently and provide instant responses to users. It improves user experience by providing quick answers to frequently asked questions, reducing the workload on human staff, and allowing them to focus on more complex tasks.

## Features

- Handles basic greetings and conversational responses.
- Provides specific responses to admission-related queries.
- Logs user interactions and bot responses.
- Error handling for 404 and 500 errors.
