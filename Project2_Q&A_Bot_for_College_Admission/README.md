# College Admission Chatbot 
This project is a Flask-based chatbot designed to assist users with inquiries related to college admissions. The chatbot can handle a variety of queries about the admission process, eligibility criteria, available courses, fees, and more.

# What is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation. It interacts with users using natural language, allowing them to ask questions and receive relevant responses. Chatbots are widely used for customer service, information retrieval, and automating repetitive tasks.

# Why Do We Need a Chatbot?
Chatbots provide several benefits, including:

1) 24/7 Availability: They can assist users at any time, providing immediate responses to queries.
2) Consistency: They offer consistent information, reducing the chances of human error.
3) Efficiency: They can handle multiple queries simultaneously, improving user experience and reducing wait times.
4) Cost-effective: They help reduce operational costs by automating routine tasks and customer interactions.
